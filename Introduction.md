# CHURN PREDICTION MODEL







## Buisness Problem description:
A international bank has been seeing unusually high churn rates. In such a scenario, the company wants to understand what the problem is and address that problem. Hence it has prepared a dataset with all the relevant customer information.

Hence, the company assessed every relevant information they had on the customers and created the dataset. 
The last attribute tells whether the customer exited the bank after a certain period.

The main objective here is to create a segmentation model to predict which of the customers are at the highest risk of leaving.

Significance: for a lot of customer centric organization, this analysis is going to be extremely valuable.

This kind of analysis is valuable as well because it doesn’t just have to be limited to customer churn rates. Demographic segmentation model can be applied to a large array of applications – for instance, even in a bank the same type of analysis can be done for getting various insights and predictions like – whether a person should get a loan or not, whether a person should be approved for credit or not, to predict fraudulent transactions in either a bank or any different financial institutions.

We know that whenever we have a scenario where we have a binary outcome and lots of independent variables, we can build a proper robust model which will predict which of the factors influence the outcome.

Therefore, the problem presented is a classification problem: i.e. to predict the response variable (i.e. ‘Exited’ in our case)


## Introduction to the dataset: 
The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle and contains information about 10,000 customers analyzed by a bank over a certain period along with 14 attributes. The last attribute ‘Exited’ is a binary response variable which tells us whether the customer exited the bank after a certain period of time (1 if the customer exits. 0 otherwise).
