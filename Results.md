Two most important performance metrics i.e accuracies and misclassification rates for all the three classifiers used are calculated and are as follows:
## Accuracies:

#### Support Vector Machine:     85.59 %
#### Artificial Neural Network:  86.15 %
#### XGBoost:                  	89.07 %

## Misclassification rate:

#### Support Vector Machine: 	14.41 %
#### Artificial Neural Network:13.85 %
#### XGBoost:                	10.93 %
